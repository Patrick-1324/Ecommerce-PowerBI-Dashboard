# Ecommerce Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
As an analyst at Digital Commerce Insights, I worked on two pivotal datasets: 'Ecommerce Orders' and 'Customer Profiles'. The 'Ecommerce Orders' dataset provided insights into customer orders, detailing products purchased, quantities, prices, order dates, and shipping costs. The 'Customer Profiles' dataset offered information on customer demographics, including email, country, membership type, and spending history.
